*jsScheme*

This is an unofficial, unaffiliated mirror for bluishcoder's implementation of an R5RS
Scheme interpreter in JavaScript.  Might need it for a project.

Original Source:  http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/jsscheme/

The meat the interpreter is embedded at the end of the index.html page, plus a jQuery
lib in /js.
